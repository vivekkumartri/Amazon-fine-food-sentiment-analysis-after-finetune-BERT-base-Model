# Amazon Fine Food Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This repository contains code for a sentiment analysis demo that predicts the sentiment of Amazon fine food reviews using a finetuned BERT Base model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The demo also includes an interface built using Gradio, allowing users to interactively input reviews and receive sentiment predictions.

## About the Demo

The sentiment analysis model is trained on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which includes:

- Number of reviews: 568,454
- Number of users: 256,059
- Number of products: 74,258
- Timespan: Oct 1999 â€” Oct 2012
- Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10

## Model Architecture

**Model Architecture:**

- `self.bert`: BERT Base model loaded from pre-trained weights.
- `self.drop`: Dropout layer applied for regularization.
- `self.out`: Linear layer mapping BERT hidden size to sentiment classes.

**Files in the Repository:**

- `amazon_finefood_sentiment_analysis_training.ipynb`: Code for training the sentiment analysis model.
- `amazon_finefood_sentiment_analysis_interface.ipynb`: Code for building the Gradio interface.
- `sentiment_analysis_finetune_bert.pkl`: Trained sentiment analysis model in pkl format.
- `rnn_lstm_gru.py`:code for Training sentiment analysis model using LSTM GRU RNN.
- result.ipynb`:code of result of comparison between LSTM, GRU, RNN and finetuned BERT Base.

**Usage:**

To run the code and interact with the sentiment analysis demo:

1. Open `amazon_finefood_sentiment_analysis_interface.ipynb`.
2. Set the file path to `sentiment_analysis_finetune_bert.pkl`.
3. Execute the notebook cells to set up the Gradio interface and make predictions.

Feel free to experiment with the interface, input different reviews, and observe sentiment predictions and confidence scores.

**Model Achievements**

- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): Achieved an accuracy of 94.8%.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Implemented an architecture with an accuracy of 93.2%.
- BERT Base Model Fine-Tuning: Achieved an accuracy of 96.4% after finetuning.

**Training Details**

All experiments were performed on a single NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. The training times are as follows:

- GRU Model: Trained for 10 epochs, took approximately 10+ hours.
- LSTM Model: Trained for 10 epochs, took around 10+ hours.
- BERT Base Model Fine-Tuning: Trained for 10 epochs, took around 15+ hours.

**Acknowledgments:**

The sentiment analysis model uses BERT architecture from Hugging Face Transformers. The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset is for training. Gradio is used for the interactive interface.
